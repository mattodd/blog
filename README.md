# Mat Todd's blog

I am a Professor of Drug Discovery with a [research group](https://todd-lers.github.io/about/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/professor-matthew-todd). 

There is a Wordpress blog ([Intermolecular](https://intermolecular.wordpress.com/)) with some older posts.
